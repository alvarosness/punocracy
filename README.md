# Punocracy

A democratized pun-generating web application.

## Features

* Generate [homophonic puns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun#Homophonic) with an intuitive query interface
* Select puns from a body of curated pun-tential phrases
* Vote for your favorite phrases, or submit your own!
* Uses modern technologies like [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and the [Go-Bootstrap framework](http://go-bootstrap.io/)

## Development and History

This project is a work in progress. The basic pun-generation/querying, rating system, user account control, curator queueing, and frontend application work as expected, but there are plenty of bugs to squash!

To build this project, simply clone the GitHub repository in your Go workspace and enter

```
go build
```

then run the resulting binary as an administrator.

This project was originally created as a group project for a graduate database course in the [Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI](https://et.iupui.edu/). For what it's worth, we got a 100% on the assignment. The three humans that worked on this project are:

* [Alvaro](https://github.com/alvarosness)
* [Mohammad](https://github.com/aronorth)
* [Nathaniel](https://github.com/Natador)
